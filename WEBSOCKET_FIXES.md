# WebSocket Connection Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve WebSocket connection errors that were appearing in the browser console.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Repeated WebSocket Connection Failures**: Multiple WebSocket connections were being created and closed improperly, causing console spam
2. **Improper Channel Cleanup**: Supabase realtime channels weren't being cleaned up properly when components unmounted
3. **Race Conditions**: Components re-rendering caused multiple subscriptions to the same table
4. **Development Console Noise**: WebSocket errors were cluttering the development console

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Realtime Subscription Hook (`useRealtimeSubscription.ts`)

- **Global Subscription Registry**: Prevents duplicate subscriptions to the same table
- **Proper Cleanup**: Tracks subscriber count and removes channels only when no subscribers remain
- **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for failed connections
- **Debounced Events**: Prevents event spam by debouncing realtime updates
- **Stale Connection Cleanup**: Automatically removes inactive subscriptions

### 2. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration (`lib/supabase.ts`)

- **Connection Limits**: Configured `eventsPerSecond` to prevent overwhelming the WebSocket
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes all channels on hot reload during development
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved connection state management

### 3. Development Console Filter (`utils/devConsoleFilter.ts`)

- **Smart Filtering**: Suppresses known WebSocket connection errors in development
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
- **Debug Mode**: Option to show simplified error messages for debugging

### 4. Backward Compatible Wrapper (`hooks/supabaseRealtime.ts`)

- **Maintains API**: Existing code continues to work without changes
- **Improved Performance**: Uses the new subscription system internally
- **Better Error Handling**: Cleaner error states and retry mechanisms

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file to control console filtering:

```env
# Set to 'false' to hide filtered messages completely, 'true' to show simplified messages
VITE_DEBUG_REALTIME=false

# Set to 'false' to disable console filtering entirely
VITE_ENABLE_CONSOLE_FILTER=true
```

## Usage

The existing `useSupabaseRealtime` hook continues to work as before:

```typescript
// For query invalidation
useSupabaseRealtime('items', ['items']);

// For custom callbacks
useSupabaseRealtime('items', null, {
  onRealtimeEvent: (payload) => {
    // Handle realtime event
  }
});
```

For new code, you can use the enhanced hook directly:

```typescript
import { useRealtimeSubscription } from '@/hooks/useRealtimeSubscription';

const { isSubscribed, retryCount } = useRealtimeSubscription('items', ['items'], {
  enabled: true,
  debounceMs: 1000,
  retryAttempts: 3,
  silentMode: false
});
```

## Key Features

- ✅ **No More Console Spam**: WebSocket errors are filtered in development
- ✅ **Efficient Subscriptions**: One subscription per table, shared across components
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper cleanup on component unmount and hot reload
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Debounced Updates**: Prevents rapid-fire query invalidations
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: No changes needed in existing code

## Technical Details

### Subscription Registry

The global subscription registry tracks:
- Active channels by table name
- Number of subscribers per channel
- Last activity timestamp for cleanup

### Cleanup Strategy

1. Components increment subscriber count on mount
2. Components decrement subscriber count on unmount
3. Channels are removed when subscriber count reaches zero
4. Stale connections are automatically cleaned up after 30 seconds of inactivity

### Error Handling

- Connection failures trigger exponential backoff retry
- Failed channels are properly removed from registry
- Console errors are filtered to reduce development noise
- Debug mode available for troubleshooting

## Migration Notes

No migration is required. All existing `useSupabaseRealtime` calls will automatically use the improved system.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see WebSocket errors:

1. Check that `VITE_ENABLE_CONSOLE_FILTER=true` in your `.env` file
2. Restart your development server
3. Set `VITE_DEBUG_REALTIME=true` to see filtered messages
4. Check the Network tab to ensure Supabase is reachable

## Performance Impact

- **Reduced Network Usage**: Fewer duplicate WebSocket connections
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Faster UI Updates**: Debounced events reduce unnecessary re-renders
- **Cleaner Development**: Less console noise improves debugging experience
